# **VIRTUAL MALL**

## **A better way to shop**

---
## 🛒 **DESCRIPTION** 🛒

### *Let's face it:*
Regular malls just don't cut it for some shoppers. It may be out of the way, only to find out the store doesn't have the item or size you want. Online shopping offers three not-so-great alternatives: 

- Amazon: thousands of off brands from another country claiming to be the best (with "authentic" and generic 5-star reviews). Your shopping experience is varied.
- Top Brand Stores: each with their own website and user experience, leaves the user's browswer cluttered while they find the right items. 
- 3rd party hosting sites: riddled with ads and popups

### **Meet VIRTUAL MALL**

- Each brand gets their own space to host and sell
- The user has only one site they need to worry about
